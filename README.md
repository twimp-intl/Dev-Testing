# Dev-Testing
This area is used as a testing ground for differnt code, ways of doing things etc. 
Mainly testing of modified code that is AI generated. But also some downloaded
examples from other sites. However, there is plenty of my own code here. 

My development area is a Debian 12 x86_64 system.
So the binaries are compiled on that. 

Copyright is not applied to any files that have been downloaded. They may or may
not contain their own copyright information. 

See COPYRIGHT for more information. 

Most of the code here is related to malware and or to Red teaming. Some is 
assembly code, some testing and elf file creation. Dammit. its possible to 
create a functioning elf binary that is 45 bytes! (true.s)

I guess some of these programs would also be helpfull if you are learning
x86 and/or x86_64 assembly as there are a bunch of those programs here. 

Lots of it is detected by AV scanners and such. 

For your own sake, DO NOT run any of these programs if you cannot read code. 
Treat them all as viruses. They very well actually might be. 
And you dont want to create a backdoor into your system by accident do you?...

There are no guarentees that any of this code actually works. Sometimes is 
may be just a test to see if it works/compiles and nothing more. 
But if there is a binary with the same name (without the .c duh!) that usually
implies that the code functions. But isnt a guarentee that source that hasn't
been compiled doesnt work. 

Like I said, its a development and testing area. You might find anything here. 

Some of the code is going to be extremely simple.

Some of the code is going to be "WTF is he even trying to do here...?"

Have fun. :) 
Don't forget to check out the links.txt in the docs/ directory for more malware 
related information. (and perhaps some of the sources for some examples.) 

Not gonna beg, but if you use any of this and make a profit from it please send
a donation at least. Any donation is going to make me happy (and probably surprised)

# Understanding Malware: From Early Beginnings to Advanced Techniques

## The First Malware

The term "malware" encompasses a variety of malicious software, and its history dates back to the early days of computing. One of the first recognized pieces of malware was the **Creeper virus**, created in the early 1970s by Bob Thomas. The Creeper was an experimental self-replicating program that infected DEC PDP-10 computers connected to the ARPANET, displaying the message: "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" 

This virus did not cause harm to the infected systems; instead, it demonstrated the potential for self-replication. The Creeper eventually led to the creation of the first antivirus program, **Reaper**, which sought to delete the Creeper from infected machines. This early malware set the stage for the development of more complex and harmful malicious software in the decades that followed.

## Polymorphism in Code

Polymorphism is a technique used by malware to change its appearance while maintaining its original functionality. This is achieved through code modification during each infection or execution cycle, which allows the malware to evade detection by traditional signature-based antivirus solutions.

### How Polymorphism Works

1. **Code Mutation**: The malware's code is altered using various techniques, such as changing variable names, altering instruction sequences, or injecting junk code.
2. **Encrypted Payloads**: The malicious payload is often encrypted, and a decryption routine is included within the code. Upon execution, the malware decrypts itself, allowing it to operate while appearing different each time it runs.
3. **Dynamic Generation**: Some polymorphic malware can generate new code at runtime, further complicating detection efforts.

By employing polymorphism, malware can stay one step ahead of security measures, making it more challenging to identify and remove.

## Metamorphism in Code

Metamorphism is an advanced technique that allows malware to completely rewrite its own code with each iteration. Unlike polymorphic malware, which may only change certain aspects of its code, metamorphic malware alters its entire structure.

### How Metamorphism Works

1. **Self-Rewriting**: The malware contains a code generator that creates a new version of itself, often using a set of predefined rules.
2. **Code Variation**: Each variant can be entirely different in structure and logic, making it very difficult for signature-based detection systems to recognize them.
3. **Functionality Preservation**: Despite these changes, the core functionality remains intact, ensuring that the malware can still perform its intended tasks.

Metamorphism enhances the evasion capabilities of malware, allowing it to bypass even advanced detection systems that rely on heuristic analysis.

## How Malware Uses These Techniques

Malware employs polymorphism and metamorphism to enhance its stealth and longevity. Here are some key ways these techniques are utilized:

1. **Evasion of Detection**: By constantly changing its code, malware can avoid detection by antivirus software that relies on signature-based identification.
2. **Sustained Infection**: As the malware evolves with each execution, it can maintain a persistent presence on infected systems, making it harder for security teams to remove.
3. **Targeted Attacks**: Advanced malware can be tailored to target specific systems or environments, employing metamorphic techniques to adapt to security measures in real time.
4. **Spread and Propagation**: Polymorphic and metamorphic malware can spread more effectively across networks by adapting to different environments, thus increasing its reach and impact.
